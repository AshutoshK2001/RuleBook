    <div class="container text-justify">
      <h1 class="text-center">Rules for AnswerHeist</h1>
      <br><hr class="bg-primary">
      <p class="text-primary">Some rules everyone need to follow for this
      exam.</p><br>
      <ul>
        <li>The total time-limit is 30 minutes for 10 questions. We will get 2.30 minutes for each question; <b>because we have to finish the exam within 25 minutes for safe submission.</b></li><br>
        <li>If we finish the exam before 30 minutes then we will revise the answer twice in order to match the answers or else we will do that only once.</li><br>
        <li class="text-warning">Set a timer of 30 minutes in the beginning of the exam.</li><br>
        <li><b>GOCS subject is mandatory for all at least go through the book.</b></li><br>
        <li>Before 10 minutes of the exam someone will start the call chain(volunteer needed for that).</li><br>
        <li>No chit chat is allowed during the exam and everyone's mic should be on mute while not talking.</li><br>
        <li>I will read the question in the beginning and each question will get 2.30 minutes to solve.<ul><li>
          If you have different question in that given number then don't panic the questions are shuffeled just find the question if its in the same page or else find the answer of the question which you have right now. <b>We will match the answers in the end so don't worry about that.</b>
        </li></ul></li><br>
        <li>After matching the questions start searching for the answer you have exactly 2.30min to find the answer. <ul>
          <li>Laptop users first google the answer because it is easier and faster to google anything on laptop. After that you can find your answer by your own method but first google it because that is easier in laptop.(<b>For laptop users only</b>)</li>
          <li>Phone users first find the answer by your own method after that match it with the notebook if that is available in notebook.(<b>Don't use google for answer because there is a chance of removing the current browser from your RAM.</b>)</li>
          <li>All this should take 2.30 minutes not more than that.</li>
        </ul></li><br>
        <li>After finding the answer unmute your mic and say the answer and its source.(Ex: If you find that answer from google then its source is google.) <b>Double check before declaring the answer.</b></li><br>
        <li>If you think the answer is wrong or your answer is right then object and declare your answer and its source.</li><br>
        <li>If your answer is same or you don't have any objection then don't say anything.</li><br>
        <li><b>Remember to mute your mic after saying that is needed for containing the silence in the exam situation.</b></li><br>
        <li>If no-one objects the given answer then the answer will be considered as correct.</li><br>
        <li><b>Don't say options like "a,b,c,d" say the complete answer for clear transmission.</b></li><br>
        <li>Everyone should try to find the answer untill it is found.</li><br>
        <li>Group chat of "AnswerHeist" will be open during the exam for posting screenshot of answer in case you complete the exam before our required time <b>25 minutes</b>.</li><br>
        <li>Keep 1 mobile extra if you have or else it is not needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>(~A trial of this will be conducted during the physics exam which is to be held on Sunday~)</p>
